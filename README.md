# About PictureFinder

In Wondows 10 there is a feature called Windows Spotlight.  
This feature downloads beautiful pictures from Bing and displays them on your lock screen.
The picutures are kept in a hidden directory and rotated on a regular basis.
I wanted to collect these pictures without the burden of regularly checking the hidden directory,
identifying the pictures, and copying the pictures to the **My Pictures** directory.  This program does that.
